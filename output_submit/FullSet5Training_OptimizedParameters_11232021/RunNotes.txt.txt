One model, using the best hyperparameters from the parameter tuning, was trained over
50 epochs on SISR Set 5.

Note that a net depth of 20 is used, rather than 10, as would be suggested by the
parameter tuning results.  This is because the neural network has similar performance
to the 10-layer, and may have more strength in learning features of larger datasets in
upcoming project tasks.
